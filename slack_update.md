# Slack Update – Company Activity Dashboard

Hey team – quick update on the Company Activity dashboard:

- Improving the daily events aggregation to reduce runtime from 3+ hours.
- Temporarily filtering only the last 90 days of data; older data remains in the warehouse but may not reflect in dashboards immediately.
- Pre-aggregation strategy in progress; will improve performance further in upcoming runs.
- Watch out for potential small mismatches for older historical data during this period.
